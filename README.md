# Cyclodextrin QSAR Comparison

This repository will detail the process of creating and comparing QSARs that predict binding affinity of small molecules to  α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrin.

## Notes about workflow

Overall, the workflow can be followed by running the R Markdown files in order. However, the "zeroth" file, `0-dwnld-data.Rmd`, can be skipped. This is the least important file for reproducibility and the data generated is already loaded in the repository. Additionally, loading the file is likely to be difficult without an academic VPN or academic credentials to download the data.
